🤖 AI-POWERED ATS RESUME ANALYZER (Streamlit + Gemini API)

This project provides a robust, user-friendly web application for analyzing a resume against a specific job description (JD) to predict its performance against an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). It uses the power of the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model with structured JSON output to provide a quantifiable score and detailed, actionable feedback for improvement.

✨ Features

PDF Resume Upload: Easily upload your resume in PDF format for text extraction.

ATS Match Score: Generates a compatibility score (0-100%) between the extracted resume content and the pasted Job Description.

Structured Feedback: Provides detailed, categorized advice across three critical areas:

Keyword Match: Identifies missing or underutilized keywords.

Content Impact: Evaluates the use of action verbs and quantifiable achievements.

Formatting & Parsability: Checks for common structural issues that confuse ATS scanners.

Streamlit UI: A clean, responsive web interface built entirely in Python.

Secure API Handling: Loads the Gemini API Key securely using a .env file.
